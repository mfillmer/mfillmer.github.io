# Design

At the start of this project, I wanted to build an atomic design system and rely on [[storybook]].
To realize this, i needed to use the right tech stack, which works at buildtime as well as at runtime.

I started with webcomponents, but soon switched to react (see [React vs Webcomponents](react-over-webcomponents)), where I also started to use [[shadcn]].

With shadcn setup, I currently see no benefit in setting up a design system or work with storybook.
