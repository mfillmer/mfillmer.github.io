# Eleventy

This static site builder is very well suited for this project. It is fast, flexible and i can play around with different frontend technologies.

I built a custom library to implement the [[Graph View]]. It parses different kind of links (wikilinks, markdown links and anchor tags) and saves them as a map. You can have a look at the data under [/linkMap.json](/linkMap.json)
