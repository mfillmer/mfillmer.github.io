# Layout of this site

This site, which is built by a static site generator [Eleventy](/thoughts/eleventy.md), makes use of a single simple layout.

The goal of this layout design is to support different kinds of navigation styles, to fit different types of content. (see [Navigation](/thoughts/navigation/) )

The site is currently being built and these are the main component layouts that are developed right now:

- [x] Article view in the center
- [x] Sidebar for hierarchical navigation
- [x] menu bar (header) for search and some default links
- [x] Backlinks Sections for graph based navigation
- [ ] (maybe) a place for ads that are not annoying to the reader

Mobile layout will be the same, but the flow of elements will flow from sideways to top-to-bottom gradually with shrinking screensize.
