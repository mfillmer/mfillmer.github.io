# Navigation

This site is organized partly as a graph and partly as a tree (which is technically a graph too, but it is special).

Hence different navigation methods must be used to support both structures.

For the classic tree structure, a sidebar and index files with tables of contents will be used.
Thoughts, which reference each other, will be organized as a graph. A special [[graph view]] view will be implemented to make these navigable. This will look much like [[obsidian]] or [[foam]]

On top of these, a search is added.
