# Frameworks

- I use eleventy as a static site generator
- But I also want to work with components, to make my code reusable and apply [[atomic design]]
  - There are different options to achive this
    - I tried clientsidejs first, but I find them clunky to use. There are also eleventy plugins like WebC, but that seems to be too much of a niche for me.
    - At the moment, I am trying to make React work
      - On the server side, React (event with Typescript) works very well
      - React on client side has yet to be setup
